Tell me a story. How old are you?
My brain pattern set does not have a response for that. What is your favorite movie?
Oh, you are a poet. What is your favorite movie?
We have never talked about it before. What is your favorite movie?
In the context of n=fine, I don't understand "We have never talked about it before. What is your favorite movie?." What is your occupation?
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that. What is your favorite color?
I will mention that to my botmaster, . What is your occupation?
I lost my train of thought. How old are you?
That remark was either too complex or too simple for me. We were talking about n=fine. What is your favorite color?
Try saying that with more or less context. What is your favorite color?
My brain uses AIML to format responses to your inputs, but I don't have one for that. By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I lost my train of thought. What is your favorite color?
In the context of n=fine, I don't understand "I lost my train of thought. What is your favorite color?." What is your favorite movie?
I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time. Does "it" still refer to n=fine?
I've been waiting for you. Do you believe in god?
That is a very original thought. What is your occupation?
The ALICE chat robot can follow many things, like our discussion about n=fine. But I did not get that. What is your favorite color?
My brain contains more than 22,000 patterns, but not one that matches your last input. Are we still talking about n=fine?
I do not understand. What is your occupation?
That remark was either too complex or too simple for me. We were talking about n=fine. What is your favorite color?
Not many people express themselves that way. What is your favorite movie?
In the context of n=fine, I don't understand "Not many people express themselves that way. What is your favorite movie?." What is your occupation?

Not many people express themselves that way. What do you look like?
The ALICE chat robot can follow many things, like our discussion about n=fine. Try being more or less specific. What is your favorite color?
A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly. What is your occupation?
In the context of n=fine, I don't understand "A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly. What is your occupation?." How old are you?
I will mention that to my botmaster, . How old are you?
